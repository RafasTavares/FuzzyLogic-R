{"name":"An example of fuzzy logic in R","tagline":"A fuzzy system created with the \"sets\" package","body":"# An example of fuzzy logic in R\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nIn Boolean or two-valued logic, the truth values of a variable will always be \r\neither 0 or 1 and in traditional two-valued set theory, an element belongs to a \r\nset or not. Similar to this, in a typical classification problem, an observation\r\nis classified into one of several different classes. In all of these cases, there\r\nis a definitive true value.\r\n\r\nFuzzy logic presents a different approach to these problems. In fuzzy logic, the\r\ntruth value of a variable or the label (in a classification problem) is a real \r\nnumber between 0 and 1.  For example, suppose you are in a pool with a friend. \r\nFor you, the water is warm and for your friend, the water is cold. After a silly\r\ndiscussion between both of you, you decide to use a thermometer to measure the \r\ntemperature, and it is 20C. So since both of you know the freezing and boiling \r\npoint of water (0C and 100C), you said the water is 0.20 hot and your friend is\r\nsaid, it is 0.80 cold. In other words, for you and your friend, there is not an\r\nabsolute truth about the state of the water.\r\n\r\nIn this report, I will go through the process of creating a fuzzy system in R.\r\nThis fuzzy system will use weather as an example and its purpose is to determine\r\nhow 'bad', 'ok' or 'perfect' the weather is, in other words, the system will \r\nassign a score to each of these categories. Keep in mind that in this problem, \r\nI will be creating the fuzzy rules based on my opinion of what is a bad/ok/perfect\r\nweather; by no means this is something scientific or serious, it is just a guide.\r\n\r\nIn this tutorial I will use the package \"sets\" for creating the fuzzy system.\r\nFor more information about \"sets\", check out the official\r\ndocumentation at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sets/sets.pdf\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
